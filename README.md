On this repo , I'm showing all my code practice , and exemples on machine learning models i worked on and tried my best to make it work . There will be some exemples on each type of machine learning models : supervised machine learning and unsupervised ones . I will also show my code practice on how i learned to evaluate models.

On the end there will be a folder called final project , where i tried 2 machine learning models to predict if it's gonna rain tomorrow. (if there is some grammar mistakes , i apologize since i wrote this with my hands )
